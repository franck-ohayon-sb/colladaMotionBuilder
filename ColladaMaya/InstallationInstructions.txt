To use ColladaMaya for Linux, run one of the following scripts:
./LinuxInstallColladaMaya80.sh 
or
./LinuxInstallColladaMaya85.sh

The scripts will only work if you installed Maya in the default folder,
which is /usr/aw/maya8.0 or /usr/autodesk/maya8.5

To use ColladaMaya for MAC OSX, open a Terminal Window 
(/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app), use the 'cd' command to change
the current directory to the folder that was just uncompressed, and run 
the script by typing  "./MacInstallColladaMaya85Release.sh" at the line.

The script assumes that the Maya folder is /Applications/Autodesk/Maya8.5

If Maya 8.5 was *not* installed in the default folder, the shell script
should be modified to reflect the real folder in which Maya resides.
